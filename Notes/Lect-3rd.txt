** Important Points About package-lock json **
-----------------------------------------------

1. It's lock the version. We should not keep it in git-ignore this file.
2. We should put the package-lock json file in git.
3. if i have package-lock json file then we can regenerate our node module as same.
4. package-lock json file track all the dependencies, version so we can regenerate using it.
5. package-lock json regenerate all the 'dependencies' in server side so we push only package-lock json file in   git-repository.

6. We should not put our node module code in git repository.
7. Never touch node modules, package-lock json, dist firectory.
